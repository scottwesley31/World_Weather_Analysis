# World_Weather_Analysis
Module 6
## Project Overview
Following the creation of an app called "PlanMyTrip" for a hypothetical travel company which allows for users to receive hotel suggestions based on a minimum and maximum temperature range, additional suggestions were made by beta testers to improve it's function. The recommendations include adding a weather description to the information displayed about each suggested hotel, which would make it possible for users to filter hotel options based on weather preferences. The app will also have a travel itinerary function which will allow the user to create a travel route between 4 different cities.

## Results
To succintly highly some of the PlanMyTrip app features, some photos were included.

### Weather Data Retrieval
A database CSV was created by requesting weather data from the openweathermap.org API with a large list of cit![WeatherPy_Database_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107309793/180908828-0f6f3586-a82a-4442-a820-3e46af9a0af1.png)
y names.

### Customer Travel Destinations Map
A travel destinations map was generated after user input of minimum temperature and maximum temperature. This was accomplished by utilizing the weather database to request hotel names from the Google Maps Nearby Search API (the closest hotel within 5000 meters for each city in the database. This was then printed on a map (via gmaps) which includes markers with city, county, weather, and max temperature information.

### Travel Itinerary Map
A travel itinerary map was generated by selecting 4 cities and creating a route (start, stop1, stop2, stop3, end). This was accomplished using the Google Maps Directions API. The result is the following map:
